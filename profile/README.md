CheechStack is a collection of components designed to streamline my PHP Web Development process. Each component is entirely independent from the others, allowing for an "as needed" approach to development. 

## Components

- [Routing](https://github.com/cheechstack/routing)

## Planned Components

- Logging
- Events
- Jobs

I started development on CheechStack in 2025, after using Laravel to create a few internal and external projects for work. Laravel's elegance and ease-of-use was a joy to work with and each project I created led me to learn more and dream bigger about what was possible within my web applications. 

My biggest issues with Laravel actually actually stem from how easy to use it is. At the surface, Laravel is basically magic. It will work with almost any front end framework and database you choose, out of the box, with minimal configuration. Authentication? Check. Routing? Check. Event Handling? Check. Asynchronous Workers and Tasks? Check. It does it all. Larevel also heavily relies on the `Illuminate\Support\Fluent` class, leading to PHP code that almost reads as plain English. While this isn't a bad thing by any stretch and 100% made my job significantly easier, it didn't teach me much in the way of *technical skills.* 

*I became good at Laravel, __not__ PHP.*

Thus **CheechStack** was born. I took the various components and concepts I enjoyed from Laravel, and figured out my own versions of them to suit my development needs. This not only taught me how Laravel operates under the hood, but I also got some great hands on experience on some previously unexplored parts of PHP such as `call_user_func` and "sessions".
